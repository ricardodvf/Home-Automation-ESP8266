# Home-Automation-ESP8266
### Hobbie Project for Home Automation.
This project uses a "Home Station" consisting of an ESP8266 paired with an NRF24L01 wireless module to control "remote" stations.  The remote stations are made with Arduino micro or Arduino nano with NRF24L01 modules that control contactors or other devices.

Some of the remote stations have DHT11 temperature sensors and they report the information back to the "Home Station".

The Home Station has a TFT screen with touch sensing capabalities.  The screen is used to display the status of the "remote" stations.

This is a work in progress and so far the only working remote station is a contactor that controls the water pump for a fish tank.
